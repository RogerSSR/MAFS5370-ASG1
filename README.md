 Discrete-Time Asset-Allocation Case Description

Consider the discrete-time asset allocation example in section 8.4 of Rao and Jelvis. Suppose the single-time-step return of the risky asset from time t to t+1 as $Y_t$ =a, prob=p, and b, prob=(1-p) . Suppose that T =10, use the TD method to find the Q function, and hence the optimal strategy.
